# 6-Letter Word Game (Wordle-style)

A lightweight Wordle-style guessing game built with vanilla **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**.  
Guess the hidden **6-letter** word within a limited number of attempts. The game supports both **physical keyboard input** and an **on-screen keyboard**, and saves progress using **localStorage**.

This project uses the public word API from **words.trex-sandwich.com**:

- Random 6-letter word (target word):  
  `https://words.trex-sandwich.com/?count=1&length=6`

- Validate a guessed word (example):  
  `https://words.trex-sandwich.com/<word>`

> Note: An internet connection is required to fetch and validate words. If the API is unavailable, gameplay may be affected.
